## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(remove: Define what category  (or combination of categories) of simulation needed to solve this problem.)
I would need to use a combination of discrete and continous simulation.
(remove: Why did you choose this simulation type?)
You would need the element of simulating queues over time (the entrance and exit of the escalators) and the discrete arrival rate / processing rate (passengers that enter / exit the subway - actually physical escalator could be represented as a 'server').
(remove: Roughly, how would you conduct the simulation to produce the results from your specification?)

(remove: images say 1000 words for you...)
