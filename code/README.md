## Smart City (My Problem) Model
The subway model I created is in the code/Subway_Model_2 directory. 

The subway model I created is extremely simple and does not quite does meet all the specified requirements (**it is a simple representation of a few objects**). Functionally, the model created a child and an adult based on a person class, with associated lengths (pseudo inputs size) and radius (pseudo inputs for occupied space on an elevator step). It also creates ASME-specified escalator steps, and an escalator with length of specified number of stairs of length **l**.
